<p>My name is Anatoly Gulyaev. I am a photographer and front-end developer.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakha_Republic" target="_blank">the Sakha Republic</a>.</p>

<p>Before 2024, I had made several attempts at photography — with my family’s DSLR camera and a film point-and-shoot — but those were short bursts of trying and giving up, and I quickly lost interest. I began taking photography seriously at the beginning of 2024 while traveling through Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>My main focus in photography is people and the streets. I’ve always been a fan of candid pictures. For me, street photography is also a way to document my travel experiences. Occasionally, I do <a href="/series/khuuley/">documentary photography</a> and some fashion photography.</p>

<p>In April 2025, I compiled my photographs into a zine titled <a href="/the-asia-escapade-zine/"><i>the asia escapade</i></a>. The zine features 86 street photos taken across nine countries in Southeast and East Asia.</p>

<p>As my main job, I work as a Front-end Developer. I have worked at inDrive, Bell Integrator, and the National Library of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia).</p>

<p>I studied at North-Eastern Federal University and hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science and a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics.</p>
