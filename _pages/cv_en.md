## Summary

Front-end developer from Yakutsk, Russia. My main tools for solving front-end problems are React, styled-components and Redux. Have some basic knowledge in back-end development. Sometimes use Python to automate some routine tasks.

Stuff I really want to learn and try in action currently are TypeScript, some state management library other than Redux and Jest.

What I love in development is solving difficult problems by finding and implementing simple solutions.
