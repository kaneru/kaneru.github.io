8 easy steps to download instagram photos:

1. like some photos on instagram;
2. download Clip Stack for Android;
3. manually copy all links from instagram (using three dots > Copy Link);
4. open Clip Stack, go to Backup > New Backup > Export, this will save .txt file containing links;
5. go to Downloads folder on your phone and send a file with all links to your computer;
6. open all links in your browser;
7. hit cmd + S (ctrl + S), it will download all images, markup and scripts as an html+folder;
8. go to downloaded folder, look for a file that ends with *_n.jpg;
9. ?????
10. PROFIT

Use this for batching actual images:

```bash
cp Downloads/*/*_n.jpg ~/instagram
```

I used to download my liked instagram photos with IFTTT but instagram API and instagram itself are shit.
