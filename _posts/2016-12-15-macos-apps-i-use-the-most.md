This post is inspired by this [repository](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os). The author describes his macOS apps stack he uses the most. But I don’t see the point of having so many apps. At least 5 paid apps he owns can be replaced by only Evernote which is freemium. Many of those apps have a free (web) alternative. I highly recommend to use open-source apps. And also never use pirated macOS apps.

So here's my list of macOS apps I use the most:

* productivity
    * [Evernote](https://evernote.com) (powerful tool for me. I use it as to-do manager, note/articles/links keeper and text editor)
    * [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) (simply blocks distracting sites such as vk.com/twitter/instagram)
    * [Skitch](https://evernote.com/skitch/) (whenever I need to draw some arrows, circles and text on some images I always use this app)
    * [Pages](http://www.apple.com/pages/) (gotta switch to LaTeX soon)
    * [MacPass](https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass/releases) (stores my passwords)
    * [Vienna](http://www.vienna-rss.org/) (neat RSS reader)
    * [iBooks](http://www.apple.com/ibooks/) (one of the few default Apple apps I use. Awesome for reading epub books)
* dev
    * [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (my favourite text editor. #TODO list of plugins I use)
    * [iTerm 3](https://www.iterm2.com/) (Terminal.app replacement and must-have. Works perfect with oh-my-zsh framework for zsh shell)
    * [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) (docs with Sublime Text integration)
* social
    * [TweetDeck](https://itunes.apple.com/app/tweetdeck-by-twitter/id485812721?mt=12) (not using so much lately)
    * [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) (whatsapp sucks. Telegram sucks too but not so much)
* utilities
    * [smcFanControl](https://www.eidac.de/) (shows CPU temperature (i guess). Also I can control fan speed with this app)
    * [Amphetamine](https://itunes.apple.com/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12) (gets your mac not to sleep)
    * [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) (nice app uninstaller)
    * [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) (minimalistic torrent-client)
    * [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) (default Spotlight.app replacement)
    * [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) (it’s worth to spend $10 for 1TB cloud storage, believe me. I store all my files in ~/Dropbox/)
    * [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html) (awesome and simple media player)
    * [Android File Transfer](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) (use it when I need to transfer some files to my phone)
    * [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=osx) (SSH and FTP file transfer)
* browsers
    * [Chrome](https://www.google.ru/chrome/browser/desktop/) (default browser, sometimes laggy and hungry for my memory but it works fine)
    * [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/) (if Chrome refuses to open some site properly I use Firefox)
    * [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) (free VPN, you know. Russia, stay strong!)
    * [TorBrowser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) (dark-net, huh?)
    * [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) (apple still can’t beat the youtube bug making macOS freeze. But Safari is well-optimized for macOS though)
* adobe
    * [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) (GIMP sucks, sorry)
    * [Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) (I do some photography and this app is amazing for editing RAWs)
* music
    * [VOX](https://vox.rocks/mac-music-player) (player that can play music from your library, soundcloud and vk!)
    * [VK320](http://vk320.ru/download/) (simple music downloader from vk.)
    * [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/download/) (use it to edit audio files sometimes)
    * [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) (ID3 tag editor :\^)
